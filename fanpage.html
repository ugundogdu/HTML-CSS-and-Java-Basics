    <p>
        One of the world’s best-known and best-loved performers, John Denver earned international acclaim as a songwriter, 
        performer, actor, environmentalist and humanitarian. Denver’s career spanned four decades and his music has outlasted 
        countless musical trends and garnered numerous awards and honors.

The son of a U.S. Air Force officer, Denver’s artistic journey began at age eleven when he was given his grandmother’s guitar.
 Denver eventually took guitar lessons and joined a boys’ choir, which led him at age twenty to pursue his dream of a career
  in music.
<br /> <br />
In 1963 he struck out on his own, moving to Los Angeles to be in the heart of the burgeoning music scene. It was during this 
time that Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. was urged by friends to change his name if a recording career was to be in his future. 
He took his stage name from the beautiful capital city of his favorite state, Colorado. Later in life, Denver and his family 
settled in Aspen, Colorado and his love for the Rocky Mountains inspired many of his songs.

John Denver experienced his first major break in the music industry when he was chosen from 250 other hopefuls as lead singer 
for the popular Mitchell Trio. <br /> <br />Two years and three albums later, Denver had honed his considerable vocal talent and developed 
his own songwriting style. He gained recognition when his song “Leaving On A Jet Plane” was recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary,
 becoming their first and only number one hit. As the Mitchell Trio disbanded, Denver was climbing up the pop charts as a solo
  act with songs like “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” “Rocky Mountain High,” “Sunshine On My Shoulders,” “Annie’s Song,” 
  “Back Home Again,” “Thank God I’m A Country Boy,” and “Calypso,” solidifying his position as one of the top stars of 
  the 1970s.
